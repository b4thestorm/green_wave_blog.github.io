It's been a few months since I began my latest career experience. I was coming off
of a few years of work on one product. Now I work on many at a time.
It's interesting how many issues come up on a day to day basis that are
similar to issues on another day.

Integrations - What are they?
I posit that integrations are a fundamental software task. It often requires
porting information from one system to another. You'd build a client for one
service and then you go send the data from client A through to client B.
Or from client to home system. The possibilities are endless and the connections
can be immensely valuable.

Data Migrations - What are they?
If you asked me 2 years ago, what this was, I'd have told you it was a poorly
documented developer task in which you move information from one system to another.
These days, you ask me that and I'd say, its the whole moving company. Largely a process one engages in when there is a legacy system that is being abandoned or when data can be more adequately handled in a totally different system. There is no document on how to best do it, it's totally on the developer to define
the task.

React - What is it?
This is hands down the future of developing for the internet. HTML/JS/CSS all in one place. Its wild to because its like xml meets html. xml being a description based structural language and html being a literal structural language. It's quite beautiful in my opinion.


Site Speed Optimizations - What is it?
it's the kung fu you do, when the site is slowed to a crawl and you need to
pick up the speed on the whole operation.


Software based business - What is it?
A cleverly maintained folder that costs lots of money to share around the world. It is a labor of love and when executed correctly, can make you insanely powerful and maybe even rich.

Feature - What is it?
It takes time to flesh out. It involves many tickets. Can't be done in a day, reasonably and when shipping into production, or even to display for clients, should replicate as close as possible the production environment that the customers would expect themselves.

It's hard to get right, but if done well, it makes you a valuable asset to any team. This is basically what the product is. A set of features. After, this probably the most important tasks is analytics tracking and customer aquisition tools.

Bugs - What is it?
Its an inevitable reality of many people using a system. And they come in many flavors. A developer on your team could've introduced it by mistake. Those are called logical bugs. A bug could exist on one clients machine because perhaps they never updated their system and be totally constrained to that client. A bug could crop up because an update in underlying software, your software is using. There are many ways you can come across a bug
