Habit Formation

>"Not, how long does it take to form a habit rather how many times must we perform an action to form a habit?"

I've often fantasized about a life devoid of entertainment in it's traditional forms. A space in which I'd only entertain work. The premise of this hypothesis is that entertainment is a choice and that it could be   be cut from life indefinitely.

This post will take the form of an experiment. In this experiment I will be training myself via a series of cues and triggers and measure the efficiency of the resulting behavior whether it starts or not. The series of cue's will be as follows:

* before starting a learning task, I will drink coffee.
* before starting a learning task, I will begin on my mobile phone.


The idea is, that not only will I put myself to the task of X'ing out entertainment from my life. That I'd be intentional about hacking the mental cues that precede a task. The idea is generated from ATOMIC HABITS written by James Clear.
